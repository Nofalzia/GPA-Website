        <l><p>In Bahria, your overall grade for one subject is divided 
            into four main categories, as illustrated in the graph.</p>
        
        </l><br><h3>For Low Scoring Students</h3>
        <l><p>If your grades have not been satisfactory, focus your 
            efforts on two key areas:<br>
             <br><u><b>Assignments</b></u><br><br> 
            A useful hack is to ensure you upload EVERY assignment.
            Instructors often don't have time to review every submission from all students,
            so uploading all assignments — even if they are done poorly — can still earn you a decent grade.
            To maximize your scores,
            put extra effort into the first and last assignments,
            as these are more likely to be downloaded and closely reviewed by instructors.
             </p>
             <p><u><b>Finals</b></u><br><br> 
                Even if you struggled throughout the semester, remember 
                that only 50% of your final grade is based on the semester's
                performance; the remaining 50% depends on the one day that 
                is your final exam.</p>
        
        </l><br><h3>For High Scoring Students</h3>
        <l><p>If you are already maintaining a good GPA (above 3.00), congratulations! It requires significant effort to achieve this, and your hard work is commendable. Continue to focus on assignments and finals, but also pay attention to quizzes and midterms, as they can further enhance your grade.</p>
        <p>However, grades are not everything. I encourage you to seek out life experiences and professional experiences. Visit the international office in Quaid Block for exchange programs, create a LinkedIn profile, attend job fairs if you’re in your 5th or 6th semester, and focus on gaining new experiences.</p>
        
        </l><br><h3>For Underperforming Students</h3>
        <l><p>If you are on probation or at risk of it, 
        <br>
     1- Choose your subjects wisely by consulting the
     prerequisite list.
     <br>
     2- Opt for a few special classes because instructors 
     are generally more lenient there, but dont take special 
     classes in place of a subject that might create a 
     backlog in the future. 
     <br>
     3- Consider making friends with high achivers and 
     instructors (lifting karain).
     <br>
     And if none of these work, its not the end of the 
     world, mentally prepare yourself for a 9th semester 
     after the usual 8, theres light at the end of even the 
     darkest tunnels, good luck!</p><br>
     <p><b>Lastly, make friends with your seniors, they know how the university works better then you do.</b></p><br></l>

    <div id="Ads" class="container">
        <h2 class="custom-font">Ads? Maybe</h2>
        <p>If you dont see ads here, I probably havent figured Google Adsense out yet, in the mean time I could use some help with moentization, donate anything from 10 rupees to however much you feel like, its the thought that really counts!</p>
